### Library Book (Rest Backend)
## Project Description:

I am creating a node.js based Rest application which will serve as a data source for a library web application. The application will expose one rest resources
* book Resource - This will handle CRUD endpoints for managing a book list. All endpoints will only be accessed by an authenticated user.
The Project will persist data to a JSON database.

## What am I are testing.
- Express project structure
- REST API Endpoint Nomenclature
- Javascript ECMA standards
- Data persistence (JSON database)
- Unit Testing

## Features:
- You can add a new book
- You can browse through all books
- You can edit a book
- You can delete a book
- you can view details of each book

### Your application should be able to perform:
- GET Request which returns all the data in my database.json file
- POST Request which adds data to my database.json file (Note: If there is no database.json on post, create one dynamically)
- PUT Request which updates fields of a particular data using the id in database.json
- DELETE Request which removes a particular data from my database.json using the id

```
